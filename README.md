# Smart Vehicular Systems Project: Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)

## Objectives and Deliverables

from both sides while reversing, issuing visual and audio alerts.

The project deliverables include:
* **CARLA Code**: The complete system implementation.
* **Report**: A document describing the architecture, design choices, and results.
* **Live Demo**: A working demonstration of the system in the simulator.
* **Warning System**: Implemented via **MQTT** messages.
